Clycker web portal

Clycker-Web is the website that goes along with the Clycker android app.  
It uses PHP, and will need to be ran with the Clicker App for it to work properly.
The website allows teachers to add new tests.  The students can then log on and 
view the tests to take them on the clycker app.
